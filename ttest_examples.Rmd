```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Confidence intervals 
- doesnt make sense 
- is testing a null hypothesis that mean otter length for the pop was 0 inches 

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)

t.test(otter_length)
```

## T-test (1-sample t-test)

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches 

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)
otter_test 
# instead of testing a mean otter length of zero as before, now its testing a meaningful claim that mean otter length is 50 inches
```


## Two sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 40)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns) #welch does not assume equal variances 
```
